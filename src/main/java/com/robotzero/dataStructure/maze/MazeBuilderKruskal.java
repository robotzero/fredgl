/**
 * This class has the responsibility to create a maze of given dimensions (width, height)
* together with a solution based on a distance matrix.
* The MazeBuilder implements Runnable such that it can be run a separate thread.
* The MazeFactory has a MazeBuilder and handles the thread management.

*
* The maze is built with a randomized version of Kruskal's algorithm.
* This means a spanning tree is expanded into a set of cells by removing walls from the maze.
* Algorithm leaves walls in tact that carry the border flag.
* Borders are used to keep the outside surrounding of the maze enclosed and
* to make sure that rooms retain outside walls and do not end up as open stalls.
